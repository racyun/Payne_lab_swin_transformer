This folder contains three scripts:

**brightness_relabeling_micrite_221:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nKTmONmN7KLXFAvIR9FMjSJZZEgF1ux1?authuser=1
**brightness_relabeling_micrite_and_cement_221:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ec-JKiPdZuWP0tqKUt8U2aRptj4NGIVA?authuser=1
**updated_image_mask_visualizations_221:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ubV5tjAjRIRPOp--StXcvJBDRWzVrMk9?authuser=1

**brightness_relabeling_micrite_221** and **brightness_relabeling_micrite_and_cement_221** are two different versions of the same script. The script's purpose was to post-process our machine-generated segmentation masks to reduce unlabeled regions and produce cleaner training labels. It pairs each carbonate image with its corresponding mask, converts the mask into a consistent 2D label map, and then fills pixels marked as “unlabeled” (primarily label 0, and in one case also label 2) using a brightness-based heuristic derived from the original image: darker pixels are reassigned to micrite (label 3) and lighter pixels to cement (label 2), with fallback rules when only one of those classes is present in the mask. The updated masks are saved to a new directory and visualized alongside the original image and mask for verification. Note: the updated masks have already been uploaded to this repository, so there is no real need to run these two scripts. They are merely here to document my work.

**updated_image_mask_visualizations_221** is the script for displaying the image and mask visualizations. It shows image and mask visualizations for 50 labeled samples. Each row contains four images: (1) the original image from the labeled dataset, (2) a visualization of the original mask, and (3–4) two updated masks generated by my brightness-based relabeling algorithm, designed to better capture background micrite and cement.
Alternatively, one could download the PDF file titled **mask_visualizations.pdf** to see them directly.
